Adding syscalls:
1. add entry("syscallname") in usys.pl
2. add syscall in defs.h
3. add definition in user.h
3. define SYS_syscall in syscall.h
4. add syscall handler in syscall.c line 86 & 112
5. implement syscall handler for sys_syscall in sysproc.c
6. implement main function in proc.c
7. add syscall in user.h

LBS:
1. int settickets(int num)
2. allocproc.c: initialise tickets as 1
4. fork() in proc.c: set tickets as parent tickets after allocproc is called.
5. in trap.c, maintain the number of ticks that the process has run for

COW:
1. wipe out PTE_W on pte of parent for each pte.
2. change uvmcopy to map the ptes of parent to child.
3. if page fault, check which: if pte write exception, allocate new paeg for child just like in old uvmcopy.
