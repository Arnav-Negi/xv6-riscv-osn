Adding syscalls:
1. add entry("syscallname") in usys.pl
2. add syscall in defs.h
3. define SYS_syscall in syscall.h
4. add syscall handler in syscall.c line 86 & 112
5. implement syscall handler for sys_syscall in sysproc.c
6. implement main function in proc.c

LBS:
1. int settickets(int num)
2. allocproc.c: initialise tickets as 1
4. fork() in proc.c: set tickets as parent tickets after allocproc is called.
5. in trap.c, maintain the number of ticks that the process has run for
